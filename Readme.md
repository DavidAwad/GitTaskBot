# GitTaskBot

This is a python app to run against your projects, if you have TODO's running
rampant in your codebase, you might miss something!

You can run this script and turn any of your `TODO` notes into github issues
for you to deal with on your own.

For that matter you can use any keyword you want, and you'll get an alert about
it.


Feel free to try the command line utility
